                            <p>Hey there, my friends!</p>

                            <p>It's February 2026. The world didn't end with AGI (yet), but the life of a Computer
                                Vision engineer has changed more in the last 12 months than in the previous decade.
                                Paradigms have shifted, and what worked just a couple of years ago is now effectively
                                legacy. 😅</p>

                            <p>To stay competitive in this era of AI, you need a new toolkit.
                                Here's what's actually moving the needle this year.</p>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">1. VLMs: The New Foundation </h3>
                            <p>In 2026, "Computer Vision" is just a subset of Multimodal LLMs. If you can't integrate a
                                vision-language backbone into your pipeline, you're building a pager in the era of
                                smartphones. It's no longer about "Is this a car?" but rather "Based on the car's
                                trajectory and the driver's head posture, what is the probability they'll ignore that
                                stop sign?"</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>What to learn:</strong> Fine-tuning VLMs (like the latest iterations of

                                <li><strong>Zero-shot detection:</strong> The ability to find and identify objects
                                    without
                                    any specific training on that class, relying on the model's vast internal knowledge.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                moved from 2D bounding boxes to <strong>Spatial Grounding</strong>: the ability to map
                                visual features directly onto precise 3D coordinates in the physical world.</p>

                                    using only a monocular camera, are you even trying?
                                </li>

                            <p>Annotating data by hand in 2026 is considered a form of digital archeology. Modern CV
                                engineers build <strong>data engines</strong>, not datasets. But the real shift is
                                towards <strong>World Models</strong>.</p>
                            <p>As <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yann-lecun/" target="_blank">Yann LeCun</a>
                                famously argued with his <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08544" target="_blank">JEPA
                                    (Joint-Embedding
                                    Predictive Architecture)</a>, true intelligence requires internal models that
                                predict how the world evolves. In 2026, we've moved past simple frame-to-frame
                                prediction. We now train models that understand <strong>causality</strong> and
                                <strong>physics</strong> within a latent space. If you're building for robotics or
                                autonomous systems, understanding V-JEPA is no longer optional - it's the baseline.

                                "Build-it-All" Mentality</h3>
                            <p>Here's the hard truth: <strong>nobody cares if you can just train a model
                                    anymore.</strong> In 2026, the industry is looking for engineers who own the entire
                                feature life cycle. If you can't take a feature from a napkin sketch to a running
                                production service, you're just a researcher in an engineer's clothing.</p>
                            <p>Being "Full-Cycle" means being responsible for:</p>

                                <li><strong>Data Pipeline:</strong> Managing your own collection and weak-labeling

                                <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Containerizing your models with
                                    <strong>Docker</strong> and optimizing them for deployment via
                                    <strong>Triton</strong>, <strong>TensorRT</strong>, or edge-specific runtimes like
                                    <strong>MNN</strong>, <strong>ONNX Runtime</strong>, and <strong>TFLite</strong>.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>MLOps:</strong> Setting up CI/CD for your weights and monitoring for data
                                    drift in the wild.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The distance between "it works on my GPU" and "it works for 10M users" is where the best

                            </h3>
                            <p>Welcome to the era of <strong>Vibe Coding</strong>. With LLMs handling 80% of the
                                boilerplate, "knowing the API" is a low-tier skill. What matters now is
                                <strong>Architectural Intuition</strong>. In a 2026 system design interview, you won't
                                be asked to write a shader; you'll be asked how to architect a real-time multimodal
                                feedback loop for a surgeon's AR headset.
                            </p>
                            <p>Hiring managers want to see if you understand the <strong>product logic</strong>: How
                                does the AI failure mode affect the UX? Where is the bottleneck: latency, bandwidth, or
                                compute? If you can't "vibe" with the product's fundamental functioning, no amount of
                                clean code will save you.</p>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Interviewing in 2026: The "Vibe Check"
                            </h3>
                            <p>You might think that because we have AI that writes code, interviews are easier.
                                <strong>Wrong.</strong> They just shifted. Companies now care more about
                                <strong>Architectural Intuition</strong> than whether you remember the formula for Batch
                                Norm (spoiler: we don't use it as much anyway).
                            </p>

                            <p>And yes, before you ask: the <strong>Good Old Leetcode</strong> is still here. Why?
                                Because it's the ultimate filter for "can this person actually think when they're
                                stressed?" So don't throw away those Python scripts just yet. 🐍</p>

                            <p>Stay curious, keep your gradients flowing, and remember: in 2026, the only constant is
                                that your weights will be outdated by next Tuesday. 🔥</p>
